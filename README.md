# Portfolio — Isaac Kweku Frimpong

This is a simple static portfolio page (HTML/CSS/JS) with a dark neon theme.

What I changed

- Consolidated styles into `style.css`.
- Replaced inline styles with semantic HTML and external CSS.
- Added a responsive navigation (hamburger) with a small JS toggle.
- Merged and cleaned duplicate project sections.
- Added a contact form with client-side validation (demo only).

Quick preview (Windows PowerShell)

Run a local static server from the project folder and open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser:

```powershell
# from the project root (where index.html lives)
python -m http.server 8000
# or, if you have Python 3 installed as 'python3'
